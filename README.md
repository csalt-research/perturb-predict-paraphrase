# Perturb, Predict & Paraphrase: Semi-supervised Learning using Noisy Student for Image Captioning

This repository includes the implementation of "Perturb, Predict & Paraphrase: Semi-supervised Learning using Noisy Student for Image Captioning" to appear in the Proceedings of IJCAI (30th International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence), 2021.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6
- Java 1.8.0
- PyTorch 1.0
- tensorboardX


## Training 

### Prepare data

Download the datafiles and follow instructions given [here](https://github.com/ruotianluo/self-critical.pytorch/tree/master/data)

### Teacher Pseudo Labels

We have included a file pseudo_labels.txt which has the pseudo-labels generated by a teacher trained on 1% MSCOCO labeled data. This file can be used to train the student

### Start training

```bash
$ CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 sh train_student.sh
```

See `opts.py` for the options.
